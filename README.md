# ATP Hydrolysis Shiny App
 
A repository for the source code of the shiny app [Gibbs Energy of ATP Hydrolysis](https://mtdavidson.shinyapps.io/Gibbs_Energy_ATP_Hydrolysis/) 

This project repurposed and translated the javascript code used in the [Bioenergetic Calculators Web App](https://dmpio.github.io/bioenergetic-calculators/gibbs_atp/). The goal was to enable dynamic visualization of variables affecting the Gibbs Energy of ATP Hydrolysis (and, to a large extent, to explore the Shiny App library and R coding language).
